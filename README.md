# Smart-ToDo-App
Smart ToDo App is a Python-based task organizer that allows users to add tasks, set priorities, track deadlines, and mark completion. It also predicts how many days are needed to finish all tasks based on progress, making daily planning simpler and more efficient.
Features

1. Add Tasks

Users can create tasks by entering a title, priority level (1–5), and deadline. Each task is stored with its details and status.

2. View All Tasks

Displays a list of tasks along with:

Task name

Priority

Completion status

Days left until the deadline


This helps users easily track their upcoming work.

3. Mark Task as Completed

Any task can be marked as "Done," updating its status instantly.

4. Delete Tasks

Users can remove tasks by selecting their task number, allowing easy cleanup of completed or irrelevant items.

5. Deadline Calculation

The application automatically calculates how many days remain until each task’s deadline using date functions.

6. Progress Prediction

Based on the number of completed tasks and the assumed number of days worked, the app predicts how many days are needed to finish all remaining tasks. This adds a “smart” forecasting feature to the manager.

7. Simple Menu Interface

A user-friendly menu guides the user through the available options, making the app easy to use even for beginners.



**How It Works**

Tasks are stored in a list, while priorities are stored in an integer array.

The app uses Python’s datetime module to handle deadlines.

Task progress is analyzed to estimate how long it will take to complete all tasks.

The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit, ensuring smooth interaction.



**Project Objectives**

Implement Python fundamentals in a real-world application

Practice object-oriented programming (OOP)

Use date calculations for practical time management

Build a functional command-line tool for organizing tasks


**Advantages**

Simple and easy to use

Helps users manage priorities and deadlines

Provides time predictions for better planning

Completely Python-based with no extra libraries


**Conclusion**

The Smart To-Do Manager is a practical beginner-friendly Python project that showcases how core programming concepts can be used to build useful real-life tools. It improves productivity, encourages organized task handling, and demonstrates essential Python skills effectively.
